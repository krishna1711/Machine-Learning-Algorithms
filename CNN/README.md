# We will look into Convolutional Neural netwrok
* We have data augmentation i.e image tranformation to make a single image into multiple images to make CNN more robust
* Kera tuner to determine how many filters, kernel size and how many dense layers to be used
* We will also look into how to use pretrained model like vgg16,Resnet etc..
